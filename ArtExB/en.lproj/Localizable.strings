"Asia’s first large-scale solo exhibition of international contemporary artist Xu Bing, curated by senior curator and art critic Chia Chi Jason Wang. Xu Bing has been actively pursuing art for four decades, from 1975 to today. In 1991 he exhibited A Book from the Sky and Ghosts Pounding the Wall at the Elvehjem Museum of Art on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, a key event that laid the foundation for his artistic accomplishments and status. He infuses his contemporary art with Eastern philosophy and culture. His works engage in critical thinking about the written word and other tools of communication, the nature of art and civilization, and similarities and conflicts among different species and cultures. His works span such forms as print, paper, performance art and large-scale installations. From traditional wood carving to installation art, from incomprehensible block lettering to using animals as media, from his “Landscript” realistic landscape paintings to examinations of the textual language and symbolism of Chinese characters, his artworks possess great breadth, depth and diversity. Presented on the ground floor of Taipei Fine Arts Museum, this exhibition features including major art pieces from his early period to the present day, new works and large-scale site-specific installations." = "Asia’s first large-scale solo exhibition of international contemporary artist Xu Bing, curated by senior curator and art critic Chia Chi Jason Wang.

"New York-based Sugimoto is an international presence in the art world, but this is his first major solo exhibition in China—one that essentially amounts to a retrospective. From his series of images taken of the models in the Museum of Natural History that look like AP photos from Neanderthal times, to incredibly detailed views of various large bodies of water such as Lake Superior and the Japan Sea, to his series of photos of cinemas around the world taken while a film was playing, his body of work presents new ideas of photography, the still image and the passage of time./nSugimoto's silver gelatin prints are the epitome of a Japanese aesthetic in which simple appearances belie intricate craftsmanship and a mastery of technical form. Appreciating his works often involves wondering how, exactly, he pulled them off./nHis latest pieces, in which he captures delicate filaments of electricity that look like mini lightning strikes, the inside of a temporal lobe, or the delicately veined underside of a leaf all at once, are especially mind-boggling. For these, Sugimoto eschewed the camera body entirely, working solely with film in a darkroom—essentially turning the darkroom itself into the inside of a camera. His method challenges long-established ideas of what photography is, and experiments with what it could be. The way he does things is just as fascinating as the results." = "New York-based Sugimoto is an international presence in the art world, but this is his first major solo exhibition in China—one that essentially amounts to a retrospective.

"After three year’s work, and through 855 paintings ranging from massive to miniscule in size, Dong Yuan imagines the unlikely marriage between a Western fantasy universe and rural Chinese peasant life scene. Dong creates a comprehensive and lively world in which everything has its own role and position. Dualistic oppositions cease to exist in this universe— ritual and reality, and tradition and the transcendental coincide seamlessly, as metaphysical thought and religious ideas intermingle with the homespun and unsophisticated." = "After three year’s work, and through 855 paintings ranging from massive to miniscule in size, Dong Yuan imagines the unlikely marriage between a Western fantasy universe and rural Chinese peasant life scene.
